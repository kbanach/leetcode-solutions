# LeetCode solutions

The only reason this repository exists is because the more experienced recruiters actually browse GitHub.

Yes, you're probably one of them :heart:

Get comfortable in this repo and take a look at the code I was able to create on a given day in my life.

**Important!** The assumptions of this repository:

1. The code works.
2. On the day of writing, it's faster than at least 50% of the solutions in LeetCode and uses less memory than 50% of them.
3. It's written in a fast-and-dirty manner, because LeetCode isn't intended for learning clean coding.

Thank you for stopping by!
